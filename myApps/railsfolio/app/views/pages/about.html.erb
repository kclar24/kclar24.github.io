    Short version:  I'm a guy who spends too much time on the computer, but wishes he had more time to spend on the computer?

    Long version:  I'm a 90's kid who grew up, hit the brick wall that is "real life", and very nearly flatlined before discovering something I actaully enjoyed doing enough to call a career.  Luckily, along the way I picked on up some skills in other areas I enjoy, such as marketing and sales.  I earned my MBA and gained some great life experience as a claims adjuster and then as an event specialist at one of the top entertainment companies in Los Angeles.

    In LA, I discovered my passion for web devlopment accidentally - I had more fun building my blog than I ever did writing content for it.  So, I dug deeper, and here I am - a graduate of the Tech Talent South Bootcamp program here in New Orleans, LA, and a freelance developer.

    I'm not giving up on that blog thing, completely (That's what I keep telling myself).
